Note
====

Here are my personal cheat sheets for different technologies I use.
They are ordered by name (`git.md`), written in Markdown format with

Usage

If you just want to read them, then there's no other magic to do than
cloning the repo. Otherwise, if you would like to edit them as well, 
I suggest you to take a look at my little note taking utility :

It's an 'improved' alias to open notes in `vim` with command such as `note git`.
